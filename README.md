# GPACalculator
 Simple C++ GPA Calculator
 This is a C++ program created with the following intentions:<br>
	- Reaquaint myself with C++ file reading and writing<br>
	- Reaquaint myself with Github Desktop<br>
 Menu program gives you 3 options, 1. Create a New File, 2. Load a File, 3. Exit<br>
	1. Asks you how many courses you're taking in the semester, loads the information into a structure, calculates your gpa then saves it into semester.txt<br>
	2. If you already have a semester.txt you can modify the contents of the txt file, program will load it and calculate your gpa
